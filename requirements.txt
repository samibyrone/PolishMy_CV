# Note: pdflatex CANNOT be installed via pip!
# It's a system-level LaTeX compiler that must be installed via:
# - System package manager (apt, yum, etc.)
# - Manual installation (TeX Live)
# - Our comprehensive build.sh script handles this
# 
# The build.sh script uses "MAXIMUM FORCE" installation strategies:
# 1. Multiple apt-get attempts with different flags
# 2. Individual package installation with fallbacks
# 3. Manual TeX Live installation from source
# 4. Symlink creation and PATH management
# 5. Enhanced wrapper scripts as final fallback
